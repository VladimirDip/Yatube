This is my first project on Django.
This will add new sting when I will write anything code :)"

Day 1: I start to learn Django and created a model and an profile 
admin.

Day 2: I start create homepage and I have many problems in real 
life and don't have time that write code. But I try to do it .

Day 3: I come back after New Year holidays. I continue to write
my project. Now I add static files for homepage

Day 4-5: It's hard time when you could go to work in offline
and writing code. So, I am continuing to learn Django.
    New Files: 
        such as folder users/ 
    New skills site: 
        Can find an article by the word,
        Can registration,
        And some cleaned code
